notes on how i approached this

downloaded
read readme
read style guide
created css file
added it to the html file
added font awesome to the html file
added fonts to the css file
added initial styling (fonts, background color, background image)
in html file I 
    added header
    added divs for sections (logo, middle, social media buttons)
    put divs around existing content (text for right side)
    added logo
    added mockup image
    added icons for social media
    saved it out
moved on to css
    adjust positioning based on how it looks on design
    got things roughly in position.
    pause for bed, however curious how I am in relation to design file
    realise I really can't match 1440x800 because the laptop I'm using is only 1366x768 (originally thought it was 2560x1440, page said only 1440 ... easy mistake. Had to look at design image for res)
go to sleep
next morning I realise
    chrome in developer mode allows you to create devices of specific resolutions
    set up 2, one 1440x800 and the other 375x800
    I can then save out the image and use diffchecker.com and use the design image vs the current image of the page to compare and see how close I am. You can use a diff mode that only shows the differences (mostly in green) which makes it easier to adjust.
    Now, now I need to finish styling for desktop ...

Things I've not touched so far:
    main section
    accessibility
    mobile
