Well a little under 2 hours later, I've made zero progress on this project BUT I have set up a basic style for the top level project index page. Wasn't what I intended to do, but I'm actually glad I did. Intention is for it to develop and become more interesting/complex as I learn more.

Last to days lost doing nothing. Spent part of today trying to find the perfect VSCode Code theme. None really quite right, don't want to create my own. Whatever it is must have different colouring for IDs and classes in css and the units should be a different color than the number.

Interesting but not quite there 

Tokyo Night - I find the Classes/ID slightly too bright compared to the attributes (green vs purple-blue)
ReUI Mirage (React) (want darker background)
Panda Syntax
Palenight Theme - issues
Night Owl
Monokai Dark Soda
Gruvbox Dark (Hard)
Firefly Pro - 
Dark Chrome DevTools - really nice, but JS REGEX is too hard to read

Added basics to the style.css from the style guide.
Again I'm setting the root font to 20px to make working with REM easier.
