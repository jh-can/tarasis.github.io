6th Sept 2020

Next project, decided to go for something slightly different with a little JavaScript required.
Added basic files for css and javascript, including a .jshintrc file

```
{
    "esversion": 6,
    "browser": true,
    "strict": "global"
}
```

Set up basic styling into the CSS from the style doc. Add colors, font + sizes.

Add font awesome to index.html + setup attribution

Add basic tags to index.html for header/main/footer, then in main splitting into 3, text headings, form and dashboard illustration.

__Q should the copyright be added to the footer or the bottom of the main????__

Started mostly with mobile

spent the morning struggling to get flex to work the way I wanted. Got there but also realised that I didn't need to use it the way I did. *facepalm*

Continue to play with positioning rather than focusing on main styling

Nudge screenshot nudge screenshot nudge screenshot *sigh*
I'm not OCD I swear ...

Realised better to social icons into footer and move the footer out of the flex container, and clamp it to the bottom.

So mobile is virtually there. The Ping! logo is slightly off, as is the "We are launching soon!"
So close *sigh*

Day break

Spent 20 minutes playing with mobile positioning. Crazy I know, but its like __near__ spot on.
