Next project, decided to go for something slightly different with a little JavaScript required.
Added basic files for css and javascript, including a .jshintrc file

```
{
    "esversion": 6,
    "browser": true,
    "strict": "global"
}
```

Set up basic styling into the CSS from the style doc. Add colors, font + sizes.

Add font awesome to index.html + setup attribution

Add basic tags to index.html for header/main/footer, then in main splitting into 3, text headings, form and dashboard illustration.

__Q should the copyright be added to the footer or the bottom of the main????__
